# Unanswered Issue Reminder

[Deploy this bot on your GitHub repo via flows.network](#deploy-your-own-unanswered-issues-alert-bot), and you will get a Slack bot that reminds you when an issue raised to your GitHub repo hasn't been responded to in a certain number of days. You can set how many days freely. It helps DevRel and maintainers to track the progress of GitHub issues.

This is a simple example of how flows.network works: When the GitHub issue doesn't get any response in 2 days, you will receive a Slack message.

## Deploy your own unanswered issues alert bot

1. Load the [unanswered GitHub issues reminder](https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/unanswered-issue-reminder) template.
2. Configure and authorize your Slack access
3. Configure the bot to access a specified GitHub repo

### 0 Prerequisites

You will need to sign into [flows.network](https://flows.network/) from your GitHub account. It is free.

### 1 Load the template for monitoring the unanswered GitHub issues

[**Just click here**](https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/unanswered-issue-reminder)

Review the `n_days` variable. This number decides how long to trigger this flow. The number here must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. 

Click on the **Create and Build** button.

### 2 Configure the bot to access your Slack

Next, you will tell the bot which Slack channel you want your alert messages to be sent to.

* `slack_channel`:
enter the name of your Slack organization where you want to deploy the bot. Case sensitive.

* `slack_workspace`:
enter the name of the Slack channel where you want to deploy the bot. Case sensitive.

Enter your Slack workspace and channel respectively in the red boxes below.

Next, let's grant flows.network to access the Slack channel you just entered. The Slack channel must be public.

Click the "Connect/+ Add new authentication" button to authenticate your Slack account. You'll be redirected to a new page where you must grant [flows.network](https://flows.network/) permission to install the `flows-network` bot on your workspace. This workspace is the one you entered into the `slack_workspace` above.

> If you have authenticated the Slack access before, you can see the purple Connect button turns gray Connected button. Just ignore this step and continue the next steps.

### 3 Configure the bot to access GitHub

Next, you will tell the bot which GitHub repo's issues need to monitor.

* `github_owner`: enter the name of the GitHub org for the repo *you want to deploy the ðŸ¤– on*.
* `github_repo` : enter the name of GitHub repo *you want to deploy the ðŸ¤– on*.

Click on the **Connect** or **+ Add new authentication** button to give the function access to the GitHub repo to deploy the ðŸ¤–. You'll be redirected to a new page where you must grant [flows.network](https://flows.network/) permission to the repo.

### 4. Click the Deploy button to deploy your function.

After that, click the Check button to see your flow details. As soon as the flow function's status becomes `ready` and the flow's status became `running`, you will get a Slack message every time the GitHub issue isn't responded to in time.
